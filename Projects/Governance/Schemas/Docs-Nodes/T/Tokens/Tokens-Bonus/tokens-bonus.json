        "text": "A Token Bonus is a reward in tokens that you obtain for participating in a program that is incentivized. Taking part in these programs is desirable, as they foster Community bonds, develop healthy social relations, or encourage specific collaborative dynamics. It is for those reasons that participation is incentivized. Programs that feature a Token Bonus define a specific Pool to allocate tokens for the bonus. You participate in those rewards in a Direct Proportion to the Token Power that you let flow into the said program.",
